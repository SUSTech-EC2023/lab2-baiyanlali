# Lab 2: Evolutionary Search Operators

The main task of this lab is to implement several evolutionary search operators.:grinning:


## Before starting

### Programming language
Any programming language that you prefer, however, the sample code in this repository is written in Matlab.

*Useful links for Matlab users:*
* [Download Matlab](https://lib.sustech.edu.cn/gjyrj_116/list.htm)
* [Tutorial](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html)
* [Examples](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/examples.html)

**We use use Matlab a lot in the future labs and assignments! Please learn to use Matlab.**

### Prepare your repository
* Each student will need to create a GitHub account and clone this repository [Lab2](https://github.com/SUSTech-EC2023/lab2). If you use other programming language, there is no need to clone the repository, you can create a new one.
* The url of the cloned repository should be sent to me via Blackboard or Github classroom.

## Noisy Quartic Function:
This function is implemented in this repository and it is named as *noisyQuartic*


## Implement EAs with different crossover and mutation operators
**Exercise:** Compare their performance on the given function

Settings are given below:
* Population size 30.
* Maximum function evaluation 500000.
* 50 independent runs.

## Test your EA!
Test your EA based on different combinations of search operators

## Visualise the results
Please the figures described as follows for all the parameter combinations.
* **Figure 1** *x-axis:* current generation number. *y-axis:* best-so-far fitness value.
* **Figure 2** *x-axis:* current generation number. *y-axis:* fitness value of the best individual of current population.
